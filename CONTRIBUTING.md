# 🤝 Contributing to EcoGuard AI

We welcome all environmentalists, developers, and visionaries to help improve the Vanguard Engine.

## 🛡️ Code of Conduct

As a project for **Hack for Humanity**, we prioritize inclusivity, respect, and a shared passion for planetary health.

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

1.  **TypeScript First**: Ensure all new components and services are fully typed. Update `types.ts` if you introduce new data structures.
2.  **Tailwind Aesthetics**: Maintain the "Tactical Dark" aesthetic. Use `emerald`, `cyan`, and `slate` color palettes.
3.  **API Performance**: Avoid redundant AI calls. Use `useMemo` and `useRef` for managing heavy resources like Video tracks or Audio Contexts.

## 📬 Contribution Process

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Create a Feature Branch** (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-improvement`).
3.  **Commit Your Changes** (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing improvement'`).
4.  **Push to the Branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-improvement`).
5.  **Open a Pull Request**.

## 🎯 Current Priorities
*   Integrating IoT sensor data into the Tactical Grid.
*   Expanding the "Species Restoration" action plan templates.
*   Improving raw PCM audio decoding for older mobile devices.
